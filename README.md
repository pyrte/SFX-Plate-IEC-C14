# SFX Plate – IEC C14 Receptacle Mount

**Plate Dimensions:** 125 × 65 × 4 mm

This custom mounting plate is designed primarily for **3D printing**, but it can also be made from other materials. It’s designed to work with **countersunk M3 screws** for easy installation.

I originally created this plate to install a **HDPLEX 250W GaN Power Supply** into a **Jonsbo N4 case**, but the design should be **compatible with other cases and SFX setups** as well.

This is my **first Fusion 360 project and GitHub repository**, so please forgive any rough edges! I hope it’s useful, and feel free to experiment and modify.
